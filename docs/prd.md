## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

* **Simplicity**: Provide a user experience where a video can be converted with a minimum number of clicks.
* **Efficiency**: Create a high-quality, web-optimized MP4 that is significantly smaller than the source file.
* **Satisfaction**: Achieve high user satisfaction by being a reliable, easy-to-use tool for its single purpose.
* **Portability**: Deliver the application as a single `.exe` file that requires no installation.

### Background Context

Many users need a simple tool to convert video files for web use without navigating complex software or making technical decisions about formats and quality settings. This project aims to solve that problem by creating a focused Windows desktop application that does one thing well: it converts any video file into a web-optimized MP4. The project will leverage the Electron framework to achieve this, ensuring a modern user experience.

## Requirements

### Functional

1.  **FR1**: The user must be able to select a video file from their local Windows file system.
2.  **FR2**: The application must convert the selected video into a single, web-optimized MP4 file.
3.  **FR3**: The application must provide a real-time visual indicator of the conversion progress (e.g., a progress bar).
4.  **FR4**: Upon successful conversion, the file is saved to the user's chosen location.
5.  **FR5**: The application must contain an "About" section or dialog box that is accessible to the end-user, displaying information about the developer.
6.  **FR6**: The user must be able to cancel a conversion that is in progress. The application should then safely terminate the process and clean up any temporary files.

### Non-Functional

1.  **NFR1**: The user interface must be clean, simple, and intuitive for a non-technical home user.
2.  **NFR2**: The application must be built using the Electron framework.
3.  **NFR3**: The final application must be distributed as a single, portable executable (`.exe`) file that does not require a formal installation process.
4.  **NFR4**: The video conversion process must produce a file with the best possible visual quality for its reduced file size.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The application should be minimalist, clean, and self-explanatory. The user should immediately understand how to use it without any instructions. The entire user journey, from opening the app to saving the converted file, should be smooth and frictionless.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
* **File Selection**: The user can either drag and drop a video file directly onto the application window or use a standard "Select File" button.
* **Conversion**: A single, clear button will initiate the conversion. All complexity is handled in the background.

### Core Screens and Views
There will be only one primary screen for the application to maintain simplicity.

### Accessibility
* **Target**: WCAG AA. The application should be usable by people with common disabilities, including keyboard-only navigation.

### Branding
* The application will have a simple, clean, and modern aesthetic with no complex branding.

### Target Device and Platforms
* **Platform**: Windows Desktop (Modern versions like Windows 10 and 11).

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure
* **Monorepo**: A single repository will be used as the project is a self-contained desktop application.

### Service Architecture
* **Monolith**: The application will be a single, monolithic executable, which is standard for a simple desktop tool.

### Testing Requirements
* **Unit + Integration**: The project will include tests for individual components (unit tests) and tests to ensure they work together correctly (integration tests).

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
* The application **must** be built using the **Electron framework** to allow for development with web technologies.

## Epic List

1.  **Epic 1: Core Conversion Engine & UI Foundation**: Establish the foundational Electron application, build the single-screen user interface, and implement the core video conversion functionality.
2.  **Epic 2: Application Polish & Finalization**: Add user-facing features like the "About" screen and package the application into a portable `.exe` file for distribution.

## Epic 1: Core Conversion Engine & UI Foundation
**Epic Goal**: This epic's primary goal is to deliver a functional, single-purpose application. It includes setting up the basic Electron project, creating the minimalist user interface for file selection and progress display, and implementing the core video processing logic to produce a web-optimized MP4.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Main Window
**As a** user,
**I want** to open the application and see a simple, clean window,
**so that** I have a starting point for converting my file.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new Electron project is created and configured.
2.  Launching the application opens a single, fixed-size desktop window.
3.  The window has the title "Desktop Video Converter".

### Story 1.2: Implement File and Destination Selection
**As a** user,
**I want** to select a video file and confirm its destination before starting,
**so that** I know where my converted file will be saved.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  The main window displays a "Select Video File" button.
2.  After a user selects a video file, its name is displayed.
3.  A "Save Destination" field appears, pre-populated with the user's **Desktop** as the default output path and a filename (e.g., `original-name_converted.mp4`).
4.  A "Change" button next to the destination field allows the user to open a "Save As" dialog to modify the location and filename if desired.
5.  A "Convert" button becomes active only after a source file has been selected.

### Story 1.3: Implement Conversion to a Defined Destination
**As a** user,
**I want** to start the conversion and have the file saved automatically to my chosen location,
**so that** the process is simple and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  Clicking the active "Convert" button starts the video conversion process.
2.  During conversion, a progress bar is displayed, and all other controls (Select, Change, Convert) are disabled.
3.  A "Cancel" button becomes active during the conversion.
4.  Clicking "Cancel" immediately stops the conversion process, deletes any temporary files, and returns the application to its pre-conversion state.
5.  When the conversion completes successfully, the file is saved to the destination path defined in Story 1.2.
6.  A success message is displayed, and an "Open Folder" button appears, which opens the destination folder in Windows Explorer.

## Epic 2: Application Polish & Finalization
**Epic Goal**: This epic adds the final professional touches to the application. It includes implementing the "About" screen for developer credit and packaging the application so it's ready for easy distribution to users.

### Story 2.1: Implement "About" Screen
**As a** user,
**I want** to access an "About" screen,
**so that** I can see information about the application and its developer.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  An "About" button or menu item is clearly visible on the main screen.
2.  Clicking the "About" button opens a small, simple dialog window.
3.  The dialog displays the application's name, version number, and the developer's information.

### Story 2.2: Package Application for Distribution
**As a** developer,
**I want** to package the application into a single portable `.exe` file,
**so that** it can be easily shared with Windows users.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  The project's build process is configured to generate a single `.exe` file.
2.  The generated `.exe` can be run on a target Windows machine (Windows 10/11) without needing a separate installation process.
3.  The packaged application launches and performs all functions correctly.

## Checklist Results Report
* **Result**: **PASS**
* **Summary**: The PRD is comprehensive, clear, and well-scoped for an MVP. The requirements are directly aligned with the project goals, and the epic structure is logical and sequential. The document is considered complete and ready for the next phase.

## Next Steps

This PRD will now be handed off to the UX Expert and the Architect to create the detailed technical and design plans.

### UX Expert Prompt
> Based on the attached PRD for the 'Desktop Video Converter', please create a detailed UI/UX Specification. Focus on the single-screen interface, the file selection/destination workflow, and the conversion progress display. The target user is a non-technical home user who values simplicity.

### Architect Prompt
> Based on the attached PRD, please create a Frontend Architecture document for the 'Desktop Video Converter'. Key technical constraints include using the Electron framework and packaging the application as a portable `.exe`.
