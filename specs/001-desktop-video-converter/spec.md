## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A home user has a video file they want to optimize for web use. They open the Desktop Video Converter application, select their video file either by clicking "Select Video File" or dragging it onto the window, confirm the destination (defaulting to Desktop with "_converted" suffix), click "Convert", watch the progress bar, and receive their optimized MP4 file in the chosen location.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is launched, **When** user clicks "Select Video File" and chooses a valid video, **Then** the filename displays and "Convert" button becomes active
2. **Given** a video file is selected, **When** user clicks "Convert", **Then** progress bar appears and conversion begins with real-time updates
3. **Given** conversion is in progress, **When** user clicks "Cancel", **Then** process stops immediately and temporary files are cleaned up
4. **Given** conversion completes successfully, **When** user sees success message, **Then** "Open Folder" button opens destination directory in Windows Explorer
5. **Given** no video file selected, **When** user attempts any action, **Then** "Convert" button remains disabled until file selection

### Edge Cases
- What happens when selected file is not a valid video format? System displays error message and allows new selection
- How does system handle insufficient disk space? Conversion fails gracefully with clear error message
- What if user selects read-only destination? Error displayed with request to choose different location
- How does system behave if conversion is interrupted by system shutdown? Temporary files cleaned on next application start

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to select video files from local Windows file system via button click or drag-and-drop
- **FR-002**: System MUST display selected video filename clearly in the interface
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide destination path selection with default to user's Desktop directory
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically generate output filename with "_converted" suffix while preserving original name
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable "Convert" button only after valid video file selection
- **FR-006**: System MUST convert selected video to web-optimized MP4 format with best quality-to-size ratio
- **FR-007**: System MUST display real-time progress indicator during conversion process
- **FR-008**: System MUST disable all controls except "Cancel" during active conversion
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide immediate conversion cancellation with complete cleanup of temporary files
- **FR-010**: System MUST save converted file to user-specified destination path
- **FR-011**: System MUST display success message and provide "Open Folder" functionality upon completion
- **FR-012**: System MUST include accessible "About" section displaying application and developer information
- **FR-013**: System MUST package as single portable .exe file requiring no installation
- **FR-014**: System MUST run on Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain clean, intuitive interface suitable for non-technical users
- **FR-016**: System MUST support keyboard-only navigation for accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Video File**: Represents source media file selected by user, includes path, name, format, and validation status
- **Conversion Job**: Represents active conversion process, includes progress percentage, status (running/cancelled/completed), source and destination paths
- **Application State**: Represents current UI state including selected file, destination path, conversion status, and control availability
- **User Preferences**: Represents application settings including default destination directory and window positioning
