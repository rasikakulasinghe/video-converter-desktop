# Implementation Plan: Troubleshoot and Fix Video Converter App

**Branch**: `002-title-troubleshoot-and` | **Date**: September 16, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `D:\Projects\Current Projects\Video Converter Project\specs\002-title-troubleshoot-and\spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → SUCCESS: Feature spec loaded with 12 functional requirements
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Project Type: Electron desktop app (main process + renderer process)
   → Structure Decision: Desktop app with IPC communication
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → Initial assessment pending technical context resolution
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Research IPC architecture patterns and FFmpeg integration
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Fix broken IPC communication in Electron video converter app to restore file selection, video conversion, and progress tracking functionality. Technical approach involves properly registering existing service classes and establishing robust IPC channels between main and renderer processes.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with Node.js for Electron main process, React 18.2.0 for renderer  
**Primary Dependencies**: Electron, React, FFmpeg-static, fluent-ffmpeg, Radix UI components  
**Storage**: electron-store for user preferences, file system for video files  
**Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for e2e tests, existing test structure in place  
**Target Platform**: Windows desktop (primary), cross-platform Electron app  
**Project Type**: Desktop application with main/renderer process architecture  
**Performance Goals**: Real-time conversion progress updates, handle multiple concurrent conversions  
**Constraints**: Secure IPC communication, sandboxed renderer process, FFmpeg dependency management  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user desktop application, support for common video formats (MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.)

**User-provided implementation details**: create systematic guide to troubleshoot

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (Electron app with main/renderer processes)
- Using framework directly? (Yes - direct Electron APIs, React components)
- Single data model? (Yes - VideoFile, ConversionJob, unified state)
- Avoiding patterns? (Using existing service pattern, no unnecessary abstractions)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (Services are modular, IPC handlers are standalone)
- Libraries listed: FileOperationsService, ConversionService, AppStateService, SystemIntegrationService
- CLI per library: N/A (Desktop app, not CLI-based)
- Library docs: Documentation in code comments and quickstart guide

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? (Will implement for bug fixes)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? (Will ensure proper order)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? (Yes, using existing test structure)
- Real dependencies used? (Yes - actual FFmpeg, file system, Electron APIs)
- Integration tests for: IPC communication, file operations, conversion process
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? (electron-log already configured)
- Frontend logs → backend? (IPC communication for error reporting)
- Error context sufficient? (Enhanced error handling for troubleshooting)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (1.0.0 - bug fix for existing version)
- BUILD increments on every change? (Will follow semantic versioning)
- Breaking changes handled? (No breaking changes - only fixes)

**Structure Decision**: Desktop application with existing Electron main/renderer architecture

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Current IPC registration patterns in Electron apps
   - FFmpeg integration best practices for desktop apps
   - Error handling strategies for file operations
   - Systematic troubleshooting methodologies for Electron IPC

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research Electron IPC handler registration patterns for service architecture"
   Task: "Find best practices for FFmpeg integration in Electron applications"
   Task: "Research systematic debugging approaches for broken IPC communication"
   Task: "Find patterns for error handling in Electron main/renderer communication"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with systematic troubleshooting methodology and IPC fix approach

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - VideoFile (path, metadata, validation status)
   - ConversionJob (progress, settings, status)
   - IPC contracts (request/response interfaces)
   - Error states and recovery mechanisms

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - IPC channel definitions for file operations
   - IPC channel definitions for conversion operations
   - IPC channel definitions for app state management
   - IPC channel definitions for system integration
   - Output TypeScript interfaces to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - IPC communication test scenarios
   - Service instantiation verification tests
   - Error handling validation tests
   - Tests must fail (revealing current broken state)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - File selection workflow validation
   - Video conversion process validation
   - Progress tracking verification
   - Error recovery testing

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run update script for agent-specific context
   - Add current troubleshooting techniques
   - Preserve existing project context
   - Update with IPC fix strategies

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests revealing bugs, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate systematic troubleshooting tasks following TDD principles
- Each IPC contract → contract test task [P]
- Each service registration → instantiation test task [P]
- Each broken workflow → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass and restore functionality

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests first to reveal bugs, then fixes
- Dependency order: Service registration → IPC handlers → UI integration
- Systematic approach: Isolate issues → Fix core problems → Verify end-to-end
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent service fixes)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md following systematic troubleshooting methodology

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles and systematic troubleshooting)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, verify all workflows restored)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None identified | N/A | N/A |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
