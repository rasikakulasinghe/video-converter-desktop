# Research: Troubleshoot and Fix Video Converter App

**Date**: September 16, 2025  
**Feature**: Troubleshoot and Fix Video Converter App  
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Analysis

## Research Overview

This research phase investigates systematic approaches to troubleshooting and fixing the broken video converter Electron application. The primary issues identified are related to IPC (Inter-Process Communication) handler registration and service instantiation.

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Electron IPC Handler Registration Patterns

**Decision**: Use centralized handler registration in main.ts with service class instantiation
**Rationale**: 
- Ensures all IPC channels are properly registered at application startup
- Separates business logic (services) from IPC communication (handlers)
- Provides clear error boundaries and debugging capabilities
- Follows Electron best practices for secure IPC communication

**Alternatives considered**:
- Lazy handler registration: Rejected due to potential race conditions
- Direct IPC handling in main.ts: Rejected due to code organization and maintainability concerns
- Module-based auto-registration: Rejected due to complexity and debugging difficulties

**Implementation Pattern**:
```
Main Process Initialization:
1. Instantiate service classes (FileOperationsService, ConversionService, etc.)
2. Instantiate handler classes with service dependencies
3. Register all IPC channels before app.whenReady()
4. Ensure error handling and logging for each channel
```

### 2. FFmpeg Integration Best Practices for Desktop Apps

**Decision**: Use ffmpeg-static with fluent-ffmpeg wrapper and proper path resolution
**Rationale**:
- ffmpeg-static provides bundled FFmpeg binaries for cross-platform support
- fluent-ffmpeg offers a comprehensive API for video processing
- Proper error handling and progress tracking capabilities
- No external dependencies for end users

**Alternatives considered**:
- System FFmpeg dependency: Rejected due to installation complexity for users
- Alternative video processing libraries: Rejected due to limited format support
- Direct FFmpeg command execution: Rejected due to complexity of progress tracking

**Implementation Pattern**:
```
FFmpeg Service Architecture:
1. Validate FFmpeg binary availability at startup
2. Use fluent-ffmpeg for conversion operations
3. Implement progress callbacks for UI updates
4. Handle conversion errors with detailed error messages
5. Support cancellation and cleanup of incomplete conversions
```

### 3. Systematic Debugging Approaches for Broken IPC Communication

**Decision**: Implement layered debugging with progressive validation
**Rationale**:
- Start with basic connectivity tests before complex operations
- Use structured logging to track IPC message flow
- Implement timeout and error handling for each IPC call
- Provide clear error messages for different failure modes

**Debugging Methodology**:
1. **Layer 1 - Basic IPC Connectivity**: Test simple ping/pong communication
2. **Layer 2 - Handler Registration**: Verify all expected IPC channels are registered
3. **Layer 3 - Service Instantiation**: Confirm all service classes are properly initialized
4. **Layer 4 - Method Execution**: Test individual service methods in isolation
5. **Layer 5 - End-to-End Workflows**: Validate complete user scenarios

**Troubleshooting Tools**:
- IPC channel registry inspection
- Service health checks
- Error logging with context
- Progress tracking validation

### 4. Error Handling Patterns for Electron Main/Renderer Communication

**Decision**: Implement standardized error response format with context preservation
**Rationale**:
- Consistent error handling across all IPC channels
- Preserves error context for debugging
- Enables graceful fallbacks in the UI
- Supports error recovery mechanisms

**Error Handling Pattern**:
```
Standard IPC Response Format:
{
  success: boolean,
  data?: T,
  error?: string,
  details?: string,
  errorCode?: string,
  timestamp?: Date
}

Error Categories:
- VALIDATION_ERROR: Input validation failures
- SYSTEM_ERROR: File system or OS-level errors  
- FFMPEG_ERROR: Video processing errors
- IPC_ERROR: Communication failures
- SERVICE_ERROR: Business logic errors
```

## Current Issues Analysis

Based on code investigation, the following specific issues were identified:

### Issue 1: IPC Handlers Not Registered
**Problem**: The main.ts file contains basic IPC handlers (select-file, select-save-location) but doesn't register the sophisticated service-based handlers that the frontend expects.

**Evidence**: 
- Frontend calls `electronAPI.file.select()` expecting IPC channel `file:select`
- Main process only has `ipcMain.handle('select-file', ...)` registered
- Service classes exist but are never instantiated

**Solution Pattern**: Register proper IPC channels with service integration

### Issue 2: Service Classes Not Instantiated
**Problem**: Well-structured service classes exist in `electron/services/` but are never created or used.

**Evidence**:
- FileOperationsService.getInstance() pattern exists but never called
- Handler classes expect service dependencies but don't receive them
- No error occurs because handlers are never registered

**Solution Pattern**: Proper service lifecycle management

### Issue 3: IPC Channel Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend and backend use different IPC channel naming conventions.

**Evidence**:
- Frontend expects: `file:select`, `file:validate`, `conversion:start`
- Backend provides: `select-file`, `select-save-location`, basic implementations
- Type definitions exist for proper contracts but aren't implemented

**Solution Pattern**: Align IPC channel names with contract definitions

## Recommended Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Establish Basic IPC Communication
1. Create IPC handler registration system
2. Implement basic connectivity tests
3. Add structured logging

### Phase 2: Integrate Service Layer
1. Instantiate service classes
2. Connect handlers to services  
3. Implement error handling

### Phase 3: Restore Full Functionality
1. Implement all required IPC channels
2. Add progress tracking
3. Complete end-to-end workflows

### Phase 4: Systematic Testing
1. Unit tests for services
2. Integration tests for IPC
3. End-to-end user workflow tests

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Required Dependencies (Already Present)
- Electron framework
- TypeScript compilation
- React frontend framework
- FFmpeg-static binaries
- fluent-ffmpeg library

### Missing Components to Implement
- IPC handler registration system
- Service instantiation lifecycle
- Error handling middleware
- Progress tracking infrastructure

## Success Criteria

1. **IPC Communication Restored**: All frontend API calls successfully reach backend services
2. **File Operations Working**: Users can select files and validate video formats
3. **Conversion Process Functional**: Video conversion with progress tracking operates correctly
4. **Error Handling Robust**: Clear error messages for all failure scenarios
5. **System Integration Complete**: File explorer integration and system operations work

## Next Phase Requirements

Phase 1 (Design & Contracts) should focus on:
1. Defining exact IPC contract interfaces
2. Specifying service method signatures
3. Creating error handling specifications
4. Designing progress tracking data model
5. Establishing test scenarios for each workflow
