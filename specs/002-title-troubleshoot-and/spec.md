# Feature Specification: Troubleshoot and Fix Video Converter App

**Feature Branch**: `002-title-troubleshoot-and`  
**Created**: September 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "current app is not working properly. Troubleshoot and find the bugs and fix it."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: Non-functional video converter desktop app requiring bug fixes
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: End users, video files
   ‚Üí Actions: File selection, video conversion, output management
   ‚Üí Data: Video files, conversion settings, progress tracking
   ‚Üí Constraints: Electron IPC communication, FFmpeg integration
3. Critical Issues Identified:
   ‚Üí IPC handlers not properly registered in main process
   ‚Üí Service classes exist but not instantiated
   ‚Üí Frontend expects sophisticated API but gets basic handlers
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User selects video ‚Üí configures conversion ‚Üí starts process ‚Üí gets output
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement addresses specific identified bugs
6. Identify Key Entities: Video files, conversion jobs, IPC channels
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec focuses on fixing existing broken functionality
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need to be able to select video files, configure conversion settings, start the conversion process, and receive converted output files. Currently, the application appears to start but none of these core functions work due to missing IPC communication between the frontend and backend services.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user launches the video converter app, **When** they click "Select File", **Then** a file dialog should open and allow them to choose video files
2. **Given** a user has selected a video file, **When** the file is validated, **Then** the app should display file information and conversion options
3. **Given** a user configures conversion settings and clicks "Start Conversion", **When** the conversion begins, **Then** progress should be displayed and the conversion should complete successfully
4. **Given** a conversion is in progress, **When** the user clicks "Cancel", **Then** the conversion should stop immediately
5. **Given** a conversion is completed, **When** the user clicks "Show in Explorer", **Then** the file manager should open to the output location

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an invalid file is selected? The app should show clear error messages
- How does the system handle multiple concurrent conversions? Progress should be tracked separately
- What occurs if FFmpeg is not available? The app should detect and report missing dependencies
- How are cancellations handled mid-conversion? The system should clean up temporary files

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST establish proper IPC communication between renderer and main processes
- **FR-002**: System MUST instantiate and register all service classes (FileOperationsService, ConversionService, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle file selection dialogs and return selected file paths to the frontend
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate selected video files using FFmpeg and provide detailed feedback
- **FR-005**: System MUST support video conversion with configurable output format and quality settings
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide real-time conversion progress updates to the user interface
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to cancel ongoing conversions
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle conversion completion and provide access to output files
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle conversion errors gracefully with meaningful error messages
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist user preferences and session state
- **FR-011**: System MUST integrate with the operating system for file management operations
- **FR-012**: System MUST detect and handle missing dependencies (FFmpeg)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **VideoFile**: Represents input video files with metadata, validation status, and file properties
- **ConversionJob**: Represents active conversion tasks with progress tracking, settings, and status
- **IPC Channels**: Communication pathways between frontend and backend processes
- **ConversionSettings**: User-configurable options for output format, quality, and processing parameters
- **ApplicationPreferences**: Persistent user settings for default behaviors and interface preferences
